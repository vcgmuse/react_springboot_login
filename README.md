React Frontend Springboot Rest Backend - Template

Currently the backend server is configured with cors and a mysql database. It handles JWT for the user but currently stores it in the seession. JWT will be handled with http only cookie in the next round. Frontend react is a simple login with simple validation. After login the dashboard page is empty and can be any number of things. This should be a general use as there still needs to b Redux introduced to manage state.
